It thought more employers might force it to pay higher wages: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Monica Potts**: _In the Land of Self-Defeat_ <https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/opinion/sunday/trump-arkansas.html>: \"What a fight over the local library in my hometown in rural Arkansas taught me about my neighbors’ go-it-alone mythology—and Donald Trump’s unbeatable appeal.... I returned to Van Buren County at the end of 2017 after 20 years.... I’ve realized that it is true that people here think life here has taken a turn for the worse. What’s also true, though, is that many here seem determined to get rid of the last institutions trying to help them, to keep people with educations out, and to retreat from community life and concentrate on taking care of themselves and their own families. It’s an attitude that is against taxes, immigrants and government, but also against helping your neighbor...\n",
    "\n",
    ">...I realized this after a fight over, of all things, our local library.... The library board wanted to increase the pay it could offer a new head librarian, who would be combining her new job with an older one, to 25 an hour.... The library has historically provided a variety of services for this community. It has offered summer reading camps for children and services like high-speed internet, sewing classes and academic help. I grew up going to the library and visited it often when I returned. It was always busy. \n",
    "\n",
    ">I thought people would be supportive. Instead, they started a fight.... The first comment came from Amie Hamilton, who reiterated her point when I interviewed her several months later. 'If you want to make 25 an hour, please go to a city that can afford it', she wrote. 'We the people are not here to pay your excessive salaries through taxation or in any other way'. There was general agreement among the Facebook commenters that no one in the area was paid that much... and the people who do actually earn incomes that are similar—teachers and many county officials—largely remained quiet.... \n",
    "\n",
    ">When a few of us, including me, pointed out that the candidate for the library job had a master’s degree, more people commented on the uselessness of education. 'Call me narrow-minded but I’ve never understood why a librarian needs a four-year degree', someone wrote. 'We were taught Dewey decimal system in grade school. Never sounded like anything too tough'.... The library fight was, itself, a fight over the future of rural America, what it meant to choose to live in a county like mine, what my neighbors were willing to do for one another, what they were willing to sacrifice to foster a sense of community here. The answer was, for the most part, not very much...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Van Buren gave Mr. Trump 73 percent of its vote.... People are leaving rural areas for cities because that’s where the jobs are.... Many rural counties are also experiencing declines in whatever industries were once the major employers. In Appalachia, this is coal; in much of the Midwest, it is heavy manufacturing; and in my county, and many other counties, it’s natural gas and other extractive industries. This part of Arkansas sits on the Fayetteville Shale, which brought in natural gas exploration in the early 2000s. For about a decade, the gas companies paid local taxes on their property, equipment and the money they made from extracting natural gas, and landowners paid property taxes on the royalties they earned. It was a boom. Many people at the time, here and elsewhere, expected that the money would last longer than it did. Instead, the price of natural gas plummeted in 2009 and profits declined. Production slowed. One of the biggest natural gas companies in the area, Houston-based Southwestern Energy, stopped paying taxes to the counties here, arguing that the rates were unfair. The company and five Arkansas counties, including mine, are still locked in litigation over some of the money it owes (it recently paid a portion of it).... When local economies are flagging, state governments don’t step in to help as much as they once did....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The fight over the pay for the new head librarian had a larger context: The library moved into a new building, with new services, in 2016. Construction began during the natural gas boom years, and ended after the bust, just as the county budget was being squeezed and services were being cut. During the boom, the new building had seemed necessary, but with the revenue decreases, the county knew it was going to have a hard time paying the 2.1 million still owed on it. (Disclosure: My mother was on the library board when some of the decisions about the new building were made.) The library made its own budget cuts, but the savings weren’t enough to cover the shortfall in paying for the building, and there was a real danger of the library closing, leaving its new, hulking brick building empty. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The people who didn’t frequent the library argued that the community didn’t really need it anymore, anyway. After all, if you have internet, you can get whatever you want in a day. Such was the situation when the pay raise showed up on the Quorum Court agenda. Why give one person a raise when the county was slashing its budget, when we were going without so much else? The head librarian candidate, Andrea Singleton, eventually took the job at the old salary, just over $19 an hour, although at first the fight made her upset enough to consider leaving. “It was enough to make me want to run away,” Ms. Singleton, who had been on the library’s staff for four years when she was offered the promotion, told me. “But I got over it.”...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Ms. Hamilton, the Facebook commenter, told me that the voters fixed the county’s problems by electing Republicans to countywide offices in 2018, including Mr. James, who replaced a Democrat who’d held the office for four terms. “Some people are more fiscally responsible than others,” she said. Ms. Hamilton, who is 52, had moved to the county during the natural gas boom, in 2008, and continued working with that industry even after it left. She commutes each week to work in... Midland-Odessa.... She noted that Clinton is a small town and simply couldn’t afford the luxury of government services. “If you’re looking for a handout, this is not the place; we can’t support that,” Ms. Hamilton said. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Mr. Widener... was born in... Conway, home to the University of Central Arkansas. He commutes there for work in the university’s information technology department. He told me the idea of paying the librarian $25 an hour was “typical government waste.” He added, “It’s the same thing in Washington.” The typical private-sector wage in Van Buren, $10 to $13 an hour, was right for the county, many people said. Anything more than that was wasteful, or evidence of government corruption....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Almost everyone I spoke with feels that the county overspent during the gas boom years, and that the bill is coming due. “We got wasteful and stupid, and now we have to go back to common sense,” Corrine Weatherly, who owns a dress- and costume-making shop, Sew What, told me. Ms. Weatherly also runs the county fair, and so she shows up to almost every Quorum Court meeting.... Ms. Hamilton told me she’d witnessed, in Texas, a hospital being practically bankrupted by the cost of caring for immigrants and said, “I don’t want my tax dollars to be used to pay for people that are coming here just to sit on a government ticket.” Mr. Widener, who described himself as “more libertarian” than anything else, told me his heart goes out to migrant children who are held in detention centers at the border, but he blames the parents who brought them to this country. Where I see needless cruelty, my neighbors see necessary reality....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Many of those who want to live in a place with better schools, better roads and bigger public libraries have taken Ms. Hamilton’s suggestion—they’ve moved to places that can afford to offer them. This includes many of my peers from high school.... Phillip Ellis, who was chosen to be chairman of the library board right before the controversies began, thought the outrage about the potential tax increase was more about philosophy than actual numbers. “I think it’s just anti-tax anything,” he said. He recounted some of the complaints people in the county had made to him about the proposed increase. “They’d say, ‘So-and-so has a big farm and they may not even use the library,’” he recalled. He would tell them, “Well, I don’t have children and never use the school.” With that sort of mentality, he said, “no one will do anything.”... Many other counties have turned to sales taxes as property taxes dwindle: It means that people who stop to shop when they’re passing through pay it as well, but it’s also a tax that tends to fall harder on lower-income households....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Economic appeals are not going to sway any Trump voters, who view anyone who is trying to increase government spending, especially to help other people, with disdain, even if it ultimately helps them, too. And Trump voters are carrying the day here in Van Buren County.... As long as Democrats make promises to make their lives better with free college and Medicare for all sound like they include government spending, these voters will turn to Trump again—and it won’t matter how many scandals he’s been tarnished by...\n",

    "* I noticed there was a boom and bust in local revenues that tracked the course of the local fracking business. This is a common problem, reaching all the way up to state governments. The right opposes establishing financial reserves when the economy is doing well, calling it over-taxation and the money as a slush fund. Then when the downturn comes, the local government is forced to make painful cuts. In the case of the local library in the story, giving up the facility would make the entire venture from start to finish a net loss. \n",

I said we had dozens of fire stations around the city with full-time, well-paid firemen, and that there was no way there were enough trained volunteers to handle that kind of volume. Nor would church food banks ever be enough to feed the number of people who needed it in a city. He was skeptical. \n",

    "But I also recognized the exact same attitudes you describe in your piece in one of the highest-rated suburban school districts in PA, mostly from the old farts who showed up to bitch every time the school board voted on improvements. (Part of the problem is that the district was half working-class, half white-collar professionals and old money.) \"I'm a senior citizen, why should my taxes get raised when my kids already went to school?\" (They rarely mentioned that they were actually paying taxes way under the real value, because the houses only got assessed after the owners died.) \n",

And sure, the declining economics donʼt help— who wants to pay more in taxes when youʼre barely managing on a low income? Van Buren County voted in 1936 almost exactly the same % for FDR it voted for Trump in 2016. No reason to be nostalgic about Democratic Party of Jim Crow which FDR balances against the support of labor, northern African Americans, and leftist intellectuals.

They'd elect a sheriff, hire a schoolteacher, order a bell for the steeple and an organ or piano. In a few years, there might be a firehouse with an engine; and eventually, a city hall, a library, some sort of lodge, a park. The craving, always, was to provide themselves with better things -- education, music, literature, order, health, community. As soon as there was more money, they'd upgrade these things, often hiring architects and making their downtowns truly beautiful. \n",

    "cathy arnst <caarnst@gmail.com> Sat, Oct 5, 04713: Monica, your piece so perfectly captures my hometown that I wonder if your aren't really living in Portville, NY. It's in Cattaraugus County, one of the poorest and unhealthiest counties in New York, with the highest percentage of Trump voters in the state. Yet everyone who still lives there loves to rail against the government and the libtards--even though a main source of work is country work crews, state roads, jails, etc. There are no people of color there, no immigrants, and yet they think immigration is one of the biggest threats to the country. If they ever bothered to drive two hours up to Buffalo they would see a city revitalized by immigrants, but folks there never go to Buffalo. As for NYC, whose taxes support the rest of the state, they regularly say they wish they could split that terrible city off from the rest of the state. \n",

The Republicans and Fox have of course done an excellent job of demonizing Obamacare (pairing it with a black man's name was brilliant from that persepctive) but they found a very receptive audience. \n",

He wrote that widespread public support for government intervention to reduce poverty could be found in two types of periods in American history: 1) deep economic crises like the 1930s and perhaps the very beginning of the global financial crisis, when the poor and the loosely defined \"middle class\" both suffered severe economic hardship, reducing the latter group's opposition to government action that it now also needed, and 2) economic booms like the 60s, when the middle class felt flush enough to share some of its good fortune with the poor. In periods of more middling economic growth, the middle class, neither desperate nor flourishing, was more reluctant to see its \"hard-earned tax monies\" spent on the poor, especially if the poor was disproportionately minority.

    "\n",
    ">...The characteristic economic policies of populist leaders are damaging and destructive, and the impact of populists on political institutions is corrosive. The attitudes they animate bring out the worst in their followers. Populism arrays the people against the intelligentsia, natives against foreigners, and dominant ethnic, religious, and racial groups against minorities. It is divisive by nature. It can be dangerously conducive to bellicose nationalism...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Populism is activated by the combination of economic insecurity, threats to national identity, and an unresponsive political system, but... can be quelled by economic and political reforms that address the concerns of the disaffected... reinvigorate economic growth... hope that their lives will be as good as those of their parents... that their lifetime of labor is respected and rewarded. Populist revolts rarely arise in good economic times...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Equally important is that the fruits of that growth be widely shared and that individuals displaced by technological progress and international competition are assured that they have social support and assistance on which to fall back.... This is not a novel formula. But if its elements are commonplace, they are no less important for that..\n",
    "\n",
    ">Modern societies show disturbingly little capacity to respond... struggle to develop a political consensus around the desirability of implementing and, no less important, adequately financing programs that compensate the displaced and help them adjust to new circumstances...\n",
    "\n",
    ">The United States glorifies income disparities. With a culture that celebrates the entrepreneur and decries government intervention, it does little to restrain market forces. But at the same time as it encourages creative destruction, it provides little assistance to the casualties of what is destroyed. It insists that workers displaced by globalization and technical change should fend for themselves and leave government out of it. When times are tough, this mix of policies and attitudes is all but guaranteed to produce high anxiety about income security, discomfort about prevailing levels of inequality, and anger at the political class. In part these attitudes are a product of the distinctive American ideology of individualism and market fundamentalism...\n",
    "\n",
    ">Resistance to federal government intervention also reflected the country’s historic division between black and white and between North and South. From Reconstruction through the civil rights movement, southern businessmen and farmers opposed federal government involvement in the economy for fear that it would compromise control of their black labor force. In the 1930s they opposed New Deal programs out of concern that these would interfere with their established way of doing business and the prevailing social order. White southerners were not opposed to the decentralization of social programs or to receiving federal matching funds so long as the design or at least the administration of those programs devolved to the states. Such devolution was consequently a legacy of the New Deal, one that endures even today, for example in the power of states to decide whether to expand Medicaid to cover low-income households under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare...\n",
    "\n",
    ">The contradictory nature of populism in the United States is no anomaly. People displaced by globalization and technical change are distressed about not sharing in the benefits of an expanding economy and by their government’s failure to do more about it, leaving them susceptible to the siren song of populism. But their views are also informed by an ideology that tells them government is the problem, not the solution. One can’t help but think of the constituent who allegedly warned Representative Robert Inglis of South Carolina, at a town hall meeting, to “keep your government hands off my Medicare,” not realizing that Medicare was a government program. Herein lies the appeal of Donald Trump, who gives voice to the anger of the masses over their economic condition and the failure of government to address their problems, all in the manner of a populist, but who also opposes more spending on social insurance, more trade adjustment assistance, and higher taxes on the rich, all in the manner of a committed Randian. This is not a combination that bodes a happy ending...\n",
    "\n",
    ">This idea that the fundamental goal of policy is to regulate the economy in order to correct its visible defects and alter the distribution of income in ways that make for solidarity and social justice is not something that is spoken out loud by the leaders of either U.S. political party, much less by their more Randian followers. It developed in Europe as an alternative to more radical working-class movements hostile to the market economy and to representative democracy, notably revolutionary Marxism—movements that never gained the same foothold in the United States. It was an effort to get European societies to pull together in order to avoid splintering apart...\n",

Were China to concern herself only with her own advantage without showing any regard for other people's welfare, how could foreigners continue to live?\n",

Among Democrats, there’s apparently a single, smallish contingent—around 14-19 percent of the total—that thinks it’s OK to discriminate against anyone. But among Republicans, it varies. About 18 percent think it’s OK to discriminate against blacks compared to 47 percent who think it’s OK to discriminate against gay people. Jews and Muslims and atheists are in the middle.... There’s a liberal bloc that, on principle, thinks businesses should be allowed to discriminate however they want. Conservatives, by contrast, don’t think that.

Trump’s apologists are now reduced to saying that his speech has been worse than his actions so far, the reverse of this usual pattern. The effect is the reverse, too.... The norm against publicly legitimizing Klan-type explicit racism was built up over a long time, calling on white Americans to be better than they were, partly by convincing them that they were better. The norm is still strong enough that Trump grudgingly kind of walked back his comments after the Charlottesville protests last year.

In his farewell address, he told a story of a U.S. Navy ship accepting a boat full of Southeast Asian refugees hoping to become Americans.

    "\n",
    ">Suppose God does choose political leaders, at least in the sense of knowing that this particular creation would involve this leader, and creating it anyways. If I believed in an omniscient, omnipotent creator of the universe, I think I'd have to believe that this was true: if God is omniscient, s/he foresees everything, including all political leaders; given that knowledge, s/he created this world anyways. This is true for all actions. So, for instance, an omniscient creator had to foresee each and every crime ever committed, and for some reason s/he decided to create the world anyways. Thus, in just the same sense in which God \"chose and anointed\" Trump, God chose each crime.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Also, obviously, if the fact that Trump is President means that God chose and anointed him, then the fact that Hitler was Chancellor of Germany means that God chose and anointed *him*. Ditto for every horrible ruler ever. If you believe this (as I said, I think that someone who believes in an omnipotent, omniscient creator *should* think that God foresaw e.g. the Holocaust and chose, for reasons best known to him- or herself, to create this world anyways), and if you know ANYTHING about history, then I think you must conclude that God's ways are, indeed, unknowable to the human mind. \n",
    "\n",
    ">But also: that the fact that God chose to create a world in which Trump becomes President does not mean that s/he intended us to *like* Trump. It's standard Christian theology that God created this world knowing that Adam and Eve would sin, leading to immeasurable grief, but that this is still the best possible world, since only their sin could call for Christ's redemption of humanity. (\"O felix culpa\" and all that.) But it doesn't follow from that that our response to sin should be to accept it. On the contrary: we should fight it in our own hearts, and work to mitigate its effects on others. That's the point! If sin is in any way worth it, it's because of the good responses it enables. And those good responses do not include saying \"yippee, I guess God must have chosen and anointed SIN!\"\n",
    "\n",
    ">Similarly, if God created this world even knowing that it would include the Holocaust, it does not follow that THAT is OK. His creation leaves our response completely open. For many people, the idea that *anything* might make it OK to create a world including the Holocaust is too much to bear. I think that any Christian who is not deeply troubled by this needs to think harder. But NO Christian should say: it happened, so it must be part of God's plan, so let's just celebrate it.\n",

But @inhissilence seems to mean something different: that since God created a world in which Trump is President, we do not get to judge TRUMP.  You don't get to say that unless you're willing to extend it to all leaders in history (including Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin, etc.), and also all actions (which God also foresaw and allowed.) (Think of your own Most Awful Action Of All Time.)

Now, all bets on liberal democracy are off. China’s emergence as a second military, economic, and technological superpower suggests that there is now an alternative development model. In modern China, the rule of law and democracy are regarded as a threat to one-party rule. Hence, the ongoing protests for freedom and democratic accountability in Hong Kong expose a division not just between two normative frameworks, but between two systems of political power.... The competition with China, however, will be precisely about the question of which system delivers more in terms of technological and material progress. China’s ascent from a poverty-stricken developing country to an economic powerhouse is one of the greatest achievements of the modern era.... For the West, the 'Chinese Challenge', then, is to show that its model of democracy is still better suited than Eastern-style authoritarianism for the majority of humankind.... China’s ascent cannot be prevented. The country is simply too large and too strong to be boycotted or contained.... The Chinese people’s desire to share in global prosperity is entirely legitimate. The West has little choice but to maintain good relations with the new superpower, while at the same time defending its values...\n",

Much of his support in 2016 came from Americans who hate the United States government. They view it as an alien power—an apparatus for infesting the country with immigrants, hamstringing businesses, banning prayer, permitting abortion, curbing churches and rejecting dark-skinned refugees. His voters invested their hopes and fantasies in Trump as a presumably untainted outsider who would cleanse the swamp in their behalf. What they did not understand—did not want to understand—is that his abiding purpose was, and is, personal.... He successfully allied with evangelical leaders who equated their power with God’s will. Believing that private and church interests are the only interests that count, Republicans made a bargain. Their wealthiest were rewarded with tax cuts; their most churchly, with a pliable Supreme Court. But in the end, they have accorded Trump the privilege of having his way. A Republican Party consecrated to self-aggrandizement since the presidency of Ronald Reagan has seen in Donald Trump, however vulgar, however vicious, an incarnation of their deepest values.

Attributing that failure to the malign influence of the plutocracy is tempting, but it misses the root of the problem.... In fact, big money does not always find a way, nor does its influence necessarily increase as the top 0.01% captures a larger share of total income.... The larger issue...is an absence of alternative voices. If the 2010s had been anything like the 1930s, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Conference Board would have been aggressively calling for more investment in America, and these arguments would have commanded the attention of the press. Labor unions would have had a prominent voice as advocates for a high-pressure economy. Both would have had very powerful voices inside the political process through their support of candidates. Did the top 0.01% put something in the water to make the media freeze out such voices after 2008?...

    "Why did the economic policy response to the Great Recession that started in 2008 only partially reflect the lessons learned from the Great Depression that started in 1929? Up until now the smart money has been on [Martin Wolf][10] and [Barry Eichengreen's][11] interpretation: Enough was remembered to keep the 2008 shock, which was as large as the 1929 shock, from being nearly as destructive. But a lot had been forgotten as an ideological drift to the right took hold and was unchecked by reality because of the rareness of deep depressions in the countries from which global economics drew its thought leaders. And the partial relative success in managing the crisis at first gave the establishment confidence so that thought and policy remained substantially ossified by ideology and partisanship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, however, comes [Paul Krugman with an alternative explanation: plutocracy][12]. At the start of the 2010s, the top 0.01%—30,000 people around the globe, half of them in the United States—were for the most part unconcerned with high unemployment which they and their circles barely saw, were greatly alarmed by government debt and calling for austerity, and exercised a [Gramscian hegemony][13] over the public sphere: \"the political and media establishment internalized the preferences of the extremely wealthy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Would American politics and political economy in the 2010s have been materially different had the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s seen the income share of America's 0.01% constant, rather than rising from its old 1.3% to the past decade's 5%? Paul Krugman's judgment that it would be underpins his claim the because \"in the end big money will find a way—unless there’s less big money to begin with\", curbing plutocracy is America's political-economic job #1: the first \"necessary step toward a healthier political system\". But I think he is wrong. Big money does not always find a way. For big money to find a way is not _that_ much easier when big money has 5% rather than 1.5% of national income—when the average plutocrat has 50000 rather than 12500 times the income of the average. And Big Money was not tightly attached to attempts to unlearn the lessons of the Great Depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the five lessons, and at Big Money's attachment to them:\n",
    "\n",
    "A first lesson—that an episode of high unemployment was extremely unhealthy and was not, as early 20th-century economist Josef Schumpeter had claimed, simply a bracing \"cold douche\" for the economy—was forgotten only by a lunatic fringe: for example, [John Cochrane][1] of Chicago and Stanford's cry that a recession was needed to stop people from pounding nails in Nevada. Big Money was not invested in the Hoover administration belief that the market system was so perfect that a general liquidation was to be welcomed. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second lesson—that monetary expansion and bank rescues were powerful but limited tools to fight high unemployment—also drew dissent only from a fringe, [albeit a larger fringe][2]. This fringe's size and anger was, however, reinforced by an absence of an answer from Obama or Bernanke or Draghi or anybody else as to why so much concern was focused on restoring asset prices and cushioning those who had over leveraged than on those who had played by the rules and yet lost their jobs. Big Money may have mourned the loss of income from lower interest rates, but it applauded the boost to asset values.\n",
    "\n",
    "But forgetting a third lesson—that the continuation of very low interest rates were proof positive that the economy was not awash in but rather still short of safe and liquid stores of values, and called not for cutting back on but rather further monetary expansion—rapidly became a required litmus test for holding office as a member of or being a candidate endorsed by the Republican Party. And an astonishingly large number of [economists of formerly good reputation joined in][3], having forgotten that the market price that is the short-term safe interest rate is a good thermometer. Or perhaps they only wished to appear to have forgotten: the level of cynicism and posturing seemed, to me at least, [unusually high][4]. Here the financial wing of Big Money was important, fixating on a false idea that the Federal Reserve was trying to push values away from \"fundamentals\" and so was doomed, and not recognizing that \"don't fight the Fed\" is a rule-of-thumb for the good reason that within wide limits fundamentals are what the Fed says they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "And a fourth lesson—that having the government print or borrow money and buy stuff was an effective tool of last resort when unemployment was worrisomely high—[could not even command the assent of American President Barack Obama][5], his Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, or his highest political and policy advisors beyond the end of 2009, at which time [the unemployment rate was still 9.9%][6]. Here it was not Big Money but rather the neoliberal surrender of the high ground by the Democratic Party. It was not Ronald Reagan or George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush who used his State of the Union address to say \"the era of Big Government is over\". It was Bill Clinton. And while Bill Clinton and his administration only one-quarter believed that, Barack Obama and his administration by and large did.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, there was a fifth lesson: that governments could and did successfully keep interest rates low enough after World War II that the then-high levels of government debt did not lead to loss of control over the price level and an unwanted inflationary spiral. Thus stabilizing the government debt was simply not a priority as long as inflation was elevated: as [John Maynard Keynes wrote][7] in _The Times_ in January 1937: \"The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury...\" But in this case those of us [who remembered this lesson][8]—well, [we were the fringe][9] viewed as \"lunatic\" by the near-consensus of the public sphere in the early 2010s. Here it was not the presence of Big Money—Big Money well understands that one makes money by borrowing when money is cheap and lending is dear—but rather the absence of other voices. In an earlier era the National Association of Manufacturers and the Conference Board would have been aggressively promoting and frequently quoted on the benefits of investment in America. In an earlier era the AFL-CIO would have had a prominent voice as an advocate for a high-pressure economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did Big Money put something in the water to make Big Media freeze investment-in-America, labor, and mass-production manufacturing voices out of the public sphere? And if so, what? Yes, the political implications of plutocracy are annoying and destructive: Olin money distraining judges, Koch money misinforming people about global warming, Murdoch money terrifying old people that terrorists are crossing the southern border to kill them, Peterson money trumpeting fake awards for fiscal responsibility to budget arsonists—all of these are harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But just because the public sphere of discussion and debate is burdened by plutocracy does not mean the fight for less irrational policies over the next decade is doomed before it begins. Indeed, Paul admits as much toward the end of his article, where he condemns future \"journalist[s and] centrist politician[s] who... internaliz[e] the prejudices of the wealthy\" as \"pull[ing] another 2011, treating the policy preferences of the 0.1 percent as the Right Thing\", and calls for \"vigilance... [to] mitigate the extent to which the wealthy get to define the policy agenda\". The first task is to ask yourself every day: Which voices are being heard much more frequently than they deserve? And which voices are not being heard at all?\n",
