    "**Rana Foroohar: US Capital Expenditure Boom Fails to Live Up to Promises**: I would note that the \"boom\" in capital investment we had in 2018 was on the order of 1/5 of what the Trumpets had promised. Rana and Daniel's point is that the \"boom\" we had was directed in directions that substitute for rather than complement labor—and thus claims it will drive wage gains are implausible: \n",

    "**Rana Foroohar** (November 2018): _[US Capital Expenditure Boom Fails to Live Up to Promises](https://www.ft.com/content/a2083406-ee83-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0)_: \"One of the key economic tales told by the Trump administration is that corporate tax cuts would spur huge investment and growth in the US economy, raising wages and ushering in a new era of bullishness. Not quite.... Nearly half of the corporate profits that were repatriated went straight into stock price-bolstering share buybacks. Capital expenditures grew too, at least for a couple of quarters. But what business is investing in has changed quite a lot... and that alters everything.... Back in 1998... 48.3 per cent of business investment went to new structures and industrial equipment and about 30 per cent into technology such as information processing equipment and various types of intellectual property, according to data compiled by Daniel Alpert.... This year, only 28.6 per cent went to structures and industrial equipment, while technology and intellectual property made up 52 per cent of all new investment...\n",
    "\n",
    ">...Investments in data processing equipment or software upgrades, which make up a big chunk of this year’s tech related spending, tend to be job killing, at least in the short term.... Investment in intangibles such as licenses or patents does represent innovation and it can enrich the owners of that intellectual capital. But such spending does not tend to improve the livelihoods of a broader swath of workers—at least not in America.... You can see these shifts playing out in the key corporate stories of the day.... Five big US companies—Apple, Alphabet, Cisco, Microsoft and Oracle — increased capital investment 42 per cent year on year to 42.6bn. But they also spent a whopping 115bn buying back their own stock, making them by far the largest beneficiaries of Donald Trump’s tax cuts, a great irony considering how the US president likes to position himself as being tough on Silicon Valley....\n",

    ">Like the Trump tax cuts, the current investment boom has benefited companies. It has been less kind to workers, particularly those who once would have benefited from factory jobs that carried good health and retirement benefits....

This is a mathematical result based on the most standard economic model.  Math doesn't care about Alan Cole's feelings.  In a one period model, one must settle for the second best. In an infinite horizon model one eventually gets to first best from now on. It is widely noted that [in a model with T periods] the optimal tax on wealth (and on capital income) goes to zero as T goes to infinity.  It is less often noticed that the way this happens is all taxation which serves any [redistributive] purpose is completed as quickly as possible...\n",

Then and only then it should leave private capital income alone.  For some parameters, the optimum is achieved with 99% public ownership of the means of production. I stress that this is the standard analysis. If the state isn't allowed to own capital, then the standard result is simply a math mistake which went un-noticed for decades. \n",

    "**Paul Krugman** (2008): _[Hangover Theorists](https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/hangover-theorists/)_: \"Somehow I missed this: via Steve Levitt, John Cochrane explaining that recessions are _good_ for you.... The basic idea is that a recession, even a depression, is somehow a necessary thing, part of the process of 'adapting the structure of production'. We have to get those people who were pounding nails in Nevada into other places and occupation, which is why unemployment has to be high in the housing bubble states for a while. The trouble... is twofold: 1. It doesn’t explain why there isn’t mass unemployment when bubbles are growing as well as shrinking—why didn’t we need high unemployment elsewhere to get those people into the nail-pounding-in-Nevada business? 2. It doesn’t explain why recessions reduce unemployment across the board, not just in industries that were bloated by a bubble.... The current slump is affecting some non-housing-bubble states as or more severely as the epicenters of the bubble.... Unemployment is up everywhere. And while the centers of the bubble, Florida and California, are high in the rankings, so are Georgia, Alabama, and the Carolinas. So the liquidationists are still with us. According to Brad DeLong, 'Milton Friedman would recall that at the Chicago where he went to graduate school such dangerous nonsense was not taught...'

    "**Project Syndicate**: _No, We Don’t “Need” a Recession_ <https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/myth-of-needed-recession-by-j-bradford-delong-2019-10>: Business cycles can end with a \"rolling readjustment\" in which asset values are marked back down to reflect underlying fundamentals, or they can end in depression and mass unemployment. There is never any good reason why the second option should prevail: BERKELEY – I recently received an email from my friend Mark Thoma of the University of Oregon, asking if I had noticed an increase in commentaries suggesting that a recession would be a good and healthy purge for the economy (or something along those lines). In fact, I, too, have noticed more commentators expressing the view that “recessions, painful as they are, are a necessary growth input.” I am rather surprised by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it was not uncommon for commentators to argue for a “needed” recession before the big one hit in 2008-2010. But I, for one, assumed that this claim was a decade dead. Who in 2019 could say with a straight face that a recession and high unemployment under conditions of low inflation would be a good thing?<!--more-->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apparently, I was wrong. The argument turns out to be an example of what Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman calls a “zombie idea … that should have died long ago in the face of evidence or logic, but just keeps shambling forward, eating peoples’ brains.” Clearly, those who claim to welcome recessions have never looked at the data. If they did, they would understand that beneficial structural changes to the economy occur during booms, not during busts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, shifting workers from a low-marginal-product activity to a zero-marginal-product activity is not progress. Nor is there any theoretical or empirical reason to think that people and resources cannot be pulled directly from low- to high-marginal-product activities during upswings, as if it takes a full washout to create the conditions for such movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those who cheer loudest for recessions usually are not consumers, workers, or employers. They are most often financiers. After all, workers themselves are rarely unhappy to be working during booms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be sure, in the 1970s, the Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas speculated that in the aftermath of a boom, workers would actually end up being unhappy for having worked during the good times. Having misperceived the prices of the goods they were buying, he argued, they would discover that they had overestimated their real (inflation-adjusted) wages: they had not been earning as much as they thought they were. But Lucas never explained why workers would have more information about wages than about the prices they were paying for groceries, rent, and so forth. Even as an abstract description of some unspecified process, the overall conjecture made very little sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the same token, consumers rarely misperceive the utility of what they purchase. And firms, likewise, are rarely unhappy to have produced during a boom. They, too, have as much information about the prices at which they are buying as the prices at which they are selling. They, too, are subject to what Lucas called “nominal misperceptions.” Monopoly (and monopsony) power can drive a wedge between prices and marginal revenues (and between wages and marginal labor costs). But, generally speaking, firms prefer to hire more workers and make more stuff at whatever the current wage/price. They will seize known opportunities in the present rather than wait around for some unknown future.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, who is really the most blinkered during booms? It is all of those who invested in outright scams like Theranos, or in risky bets like WeWork and Bitcoin. They are the ones who are sorry after the fact, and who wish that the central bank had taken away the punch bowl much earlier. If only they hadn’t succumbed to a fit of positive-feedback trading. If only they hadn’t been deranged by irrational exuberance, falling for what they heard in the financial-gossip echo chamber. As the twentieth-century economic historian Charles P. Kindleberger famously joked, “There is nothing as disturbing to one’s wellbeing and judgment as to see a friend get rich.”\n",
    "Envy and greed are the muses that always convince some to buy at the peak of a bubble. Only afterwards will these greater fools wonder why there hadn’t been more hints of the risks, or reach for some other argument to keep them in their right minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet even from this perspective, the conviction that a period of liquidation and contraction is needed after a boom remains incomprehensible. Business cycles can end with a rolling readjustment in which asset values are marked back down to reflect underlying fundamentals, or they can end in depression and mass unemployment. There is never any good reason why the second option should prevail.\n",

    "**Hoisted from the Archives**: The income distribution came on to the stage that is America's public sphere between February 14 and December 12, 1992. And the rhetoric of \"X% of gains in _per capita_ income over years Y-Z went to the top W%-iles of the income distribution\" became a one in American political-economic discourse over that time period as well. Over those ten months then-_New York Times_ economics reporter Sylvia Nasar wrote eight stories about income inequality in America. All of them were pitched at a high substantive and intellectual level—they would have fit into the _New York Times's_ later Upshot (which has recently refocused at a less analytically-substantive level as concerned with \"politics, policy, and everyday life\"). This was, needless to say, very unusual for the _New York Times_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sylvia's first story addressed the peculiar fact that the \"80's Boom\", as Reagan Republicans and the _New York Times_ called it, had seen the poverty rate not diminish but rise. Sylvia attributed that rise to union-busting, and a growing disparity between high- and low-wage jobs springing from a decline in relative manufacturing employment and possibly from boosted high-wage white-collar productivity from computerization. Her second story, on March 5, took a turn. Instead of continuing to investigate the causes of rising poverty and wage stagnation in a decade of supposed boom, it focused on \"who had reaped the gains\" from \"the prosperity of the last decade and a half\". It highlighted the \"Krugman calculation\". It began:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Populist politicians, economists and ordinary citizens have long suspected that the rich have been getting richer. What is making people sit up now is recent evidence that the richest 1 percent of American families appears to have reaped most of the gains from the prosperity of the last decade and a half. An outsized 60 percent of the growth in the average after-tax income of all American families between 1977 and 1989—and an even heftier three-fourths of the gain in average pretax income—went to the wealthiest 660,000 families, each of which had an annual income of at least $310,000 a year...<!--more-->\n",
    "\n",
    "And she, referring to his \"testimony before Congress several weeks ago\", aggressively quoted Paul Krugman, who had taken the CBO's income-distribution estimate numbers and presented them in, as one economist said to me at the time, \"the most inflammatory fashion possible that was not actively misleading\": \n",
    "\n",
    ">We know that productivity has increased since 1977 and that more people are working. Where did all that extra income go? The answer is that it all went to the very top.... The number that no one had seen was how much of the growth went to a few people...\n",
    "\n",
    "(How Paul Krugman came to be browsing and what he found in the House Was and Means Committee's _Green Book: Background Material on Family Income and Benefit Changes_, Committee Print 102-30 (December 19,1991), pp. 61-81; what his \"testimony before congress\" was; and how Sylvia Nasar found out about it and decided it was interesting—these are not things that I ever got completely straight.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened then? Well, two months later Sylvia Nasar's May 11 story is headlined: \"The Richest Getting Richer: Now It's a Top Political Issue\". According to Bill Clinton's press secretary Deedee Myers, Clinton read the March 5 study, went wild, and incorporated it into his stump speeches. Nasar called Clinton \"one of the few Presidential candidates since Harry S. Truman to woo the middle class by pummeling the rich\". She called Republicans furious: \"The Joint Economic Committee's... minority report accuses Democrats of using Joseph Stalin's approach to rewriting history. Supply-side architects... blasted the figures as 'propaganda, not data'.... Economic adviser Michael J. Boskin said he was livid... an editorial response signed by the President's counselor for domestic policy, Clayton K. Yeutter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And then it becomes coy: seeming to minimize Sylvia Nasar's role in this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">When the Congressional Budget Office first released its income data... only a handful... paid much attention.... Even after... Paul R. Krugman... concluded that the major share... had gone to the richest... had trouble getting anyone to listen...\n",
    "\n",
    "And then: \"But Mr. Krugman's arithmetic ultimately crystallized the issue...\" It was Krugman's arithmetic, Sylvia Nasar's putting it on the front page of the _New York Times_, and Bill Clinton's adding it to his stump speech that \"crystalized the issue\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By May 18 Sylvia Nasar was pushing back against conservatives who claimed (falsely) that America is a land of such great opportunity that static distribution statistics are meaningless: \"rags-to-riches remains the economic exception.... A child whose father is in the bottom 5 percent of earners, for instance, has only 1 chance in 20 of making it into the top 20 percent of families.... Much... short-term turnover may be illusory... a large fraction of year-to-year changes... reflects reporting error, timing of income like capital gains, episodes of illness or unemployment and other transitory effects... \" On June 17 Sylvia Nasar was refereeing a debate over income inequality and the relevance of the \"Krugman calculation\" between Belle Sawhill and Mark London of the Urban Institute and Glenn Hubbard of the Treasury (now of Columbia). She scores it three-love for Sawhill and London, quoting Kevin Murphy saying that what drove Hubbard's claims was \"not your classic income mobility. This is the guy who works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early 30's...\" She piled on further on July 20:\n",
    "\n",
    ">the Treasury has been quietly circulating a 'primer' on income distribution to journalists and economists. The 24-page document, prepared by R. Glenn Hubbard... asserts that the richest 1 percent of American taxpayers reaped only 11.3 percent of the income gains in the 1980's.... But experts in the field who reviewed the Treasury's calculation were highly critical, saying that the Treasury economist had fallen into a well-known statistical trap.... 'It's not a meaningful calculation', said Lawrence F. Katz.... 'I would ask Treasury to redo their calculation on the top 1 percent defined by 1988 income', said Joel B. Slemrod.... 'I'm pretty sure the numbers would change quite a bit'. A reporter had, in fact, asked Mr. Hubbard several times to make such a calculation, but he refused on the ground that the results would be uninteresting...\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"reporter\", we are meant to infer, was Sylvia Nasar, asking Glenn Hubbard a question that he did not dare himself answer, or allow others at his database so they could answer it.\n",
    "\n",
    "And on August 16, Sylvia Nasar quoted me extensively in an article trying to put the issues in perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    ">By the end of the 1980's... wealth in this country had become more concentrated than at any time since the Roaring Twenties. The share of net worth... held by the top 1 percent... jumped from below 20 percent in 1979 to more than 36 percent in 1989, according to... Claudia Goldin and Bradford De Long... and... Edward Wolff at New York University.... The wealthy's share of the total wealth expanded as much during the Reagan boom as it did in the 100 years—roughly 1830 to 1929—in which America transformed itself from an egalitarian land of small farmers into the world's reigning industrial power.... In some ways, the 1980's resembled the Gilded Age and the era of robber barons.... The biggest difference... had more to do with what was happening at the bottom.... While the pay of corporate presidents soared to 160 times that of the average worker, union membership sank, and pay and productivity, which had advanced handily in the early 20th century, stagnated.... 'John D. Rockefeller was a nasty bastard, but he built the oil industry', said Professor deLong. 'It's the combination of rapidly rising wealth for the Forbes 400 and slow productivity growth for the average American that's worrisome'....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The New Deal took from the monied... gave to the poor and middle class. Washington collected more income and inheritance taxes.... The New Deal saved the homes, farms and businesses of millions of ordinary Americans.... World War II squeezed wealth into the hands of the working classes.... The National War Labor Board—heeding F.D.R.'s directive to raise substandard wages—tended to approve raises for poorer workers while turning down raises for the better paid. The rich, meantime, had nowhere to invest except in war bonds whose value evaporated when the country inflated its way out of its huge wartime debt. It was in the mid-1970s, after Vietnam, the oil crisis and a bad recession shattered business confidence, that the wealthy's share hit a low point.... \"Prices doubled, but so did wages and home values,\" said Professor de Long, \"holders of financial assets got hammered.\" In between, the 1950's and 1960's was a golden age...\n",
    "\n",

A front-page article in the March 5 _New York Times_ described one example: an allegation that the recovery of the 1980's—and hence the conservative philosophy of the Bush Administration—helped the rich and hurt the poor. This analysis, a reprise of the so-called fairness argument, rests on a Congressional Budget Office study and an analysis by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, Paul Krugman. The C.B.O. and Mr. Krugman have played prominent roles in shaping the liberal version of the fairness debate, and their allegations have become a staple in the speeches of Democratic politicians. But the analysis suffers from grievous flaws... throwing in data from the Carter era... gives the impression that American society consists of stationary social classes—a sort of human layer cake in which a haughty, unchanging upper class rests atop an oppressed, unchanging underclass... the C.B.O. study creates the impression of an increasingly divided America by overstating the 'wealth' of the top 1 percent.... But the fairness story involves far more than statistics. It involves values. Many advocates of the 'fairness' critique want to stoke middle-class resentment by implying that the rich take from the poor. They never seem to realize that a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy can create a bigger pie for everyone.... The politics of redistribution are as dead as Leninism. Today, people in former Communist lands beg for copies of the Federalist Papers and \"The Wealth of Nations\"—not for \"The Greening of America.\" They don't seek a sleeker socialism. They seek something like what President Bush calls the Good Society—one built on hard work, decency, thrift, service, family—one that places the individual before government. The C.B.O.-Krugman assault on the Reagan-Bush recovery avoids all these factual and moral subtleties, and muddles a debate that matters to most of us. That's a shame because the fairness debate will shape our destiny. As we take on the tangled issues that arise from it, we will need all the facts and all the real fairness we can get...\n",

The conservative side displayed great ferocity.... Conservatives chose to take an odd, and ultimately indefensible, position. They could legitimately have challenged... on the grounds that nothing can, or at any rate should, be done about it. But with only a few exceptions they chose instead to make their stand on the facts to deny that the massive increase in inequality had happened... [in] an extraordinary series of attempts at statistical distortion.... The combination of mendacity and sheer incompetence displayed by the Wall Street Journal, the U.S. Treasury Department, and a number of supposed economic experts demonstrates something else: the extent of the moral and intellectual decline of American conservatism...\n",
    "\n",
    ">...My own contribution to this discussion was to point out that there is a sense in which the rise in incomes at the top is in fact a major economic issue, and to offer a shorthand way of conveying that point: the now infamous 'Krugman calculation' that 70 percent of the rise in average family income has gone to the top 1 percent of families.... To help attract attention to a trend that I thought had been neglected I proposed the following thought experiment. Imagine two villages, each composed of 100 families representing the percentiles of the family income distribution in a given year in particular, a 1977 village and a 1989 village. According to the CBO numbers, the total income of the 1989 village is about 10 percent higher than that of the 1977 village; but it is not true that the whole distribution is shifted up by 10 percent. Instead, the richest family in the 1989 village has twice the income of its counterpart in the 1977 village, while the bottom forty 1989 families actually have lower incomes than their 1977 counterparts. Now ask: how much of the difference in the incomes of the two villages is accounted for by the difference in the incomes of the richest family? Equivalently, how much of the rise in average American family income went to the top 1 percent of families? By looking at this measure we get a sense of who was \"siphoning off\" the growth in average incomes....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Many conservatives were furious when the income distribution story surfaced in early 1992.... Indeed the belated attention to inequality during the spring of 1992 clearly helped the Clinton campaign find a new focus and a new target for public anger: instead of blaming their woes on welfare queens in their Cadillacs, middle-class voters could be urged to blame government policies that favored the wealthy. So the dismay and anger of conservatives was understandable. The response from the administration, the _Journal_, and other conservative voices was, however, inexcusable: instead of facing up to the fact of rapidly growing inequality under conservative rule, they tried to deny the facts and shoot the messengers....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The CEA calculation... includ[ing] sheer growth in working-age population gets us completely away from those questions.... Many conservative commentators including Paul Craig Roberts, Alan Reynolds, Representative Richard Armey, and the editorial page of the _Wall Street Journal_ have bitterly attacked the CBO for including capital gains.... Excluding capital gains from the CBO numbers makes very little difference.... Alan Reynolds... as well as... Republican Congressman Richard Armey... did not bother to read the study before attacking it....\n",
    "\n",
    ">The second line of conservative defense has become a familiar one: they claim that the growth record of the Reagan years shows that supply-side policies produce gains for everyone, and that it is destructive to worry about or even to notice the distribution of income.... The basic proposition that the \"Krugman calculation\" was meant to convey is that income inequality has been increasing so rapidly that most families have failed to get much benefit out of long-term growth. This proposition stands. One need not take seriously the efforts by supply-siders to chop the past fifteen years into little slices, and claim the good ones while disclaiming the bad ones.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Conservative Response 3: Income Mobility.... The Hubbard Study... a report claiming that... 86 percent of individuals who started in the bottom quintile in 1979 had moved out by 1988.... But this report was based on what we may charitably call a strange procedure.... It tracked a group of individuals who paid income taxes in all ten years from 1979 to 1988, and compared their incomes not with each other but with those of the population at large. The restriction to individuals who paid taxes in all years immediately introduced a strong bias toward including only the economically successful; only about half of families paid income taxes in all ten years.... [Plus] the report essentially treated the normal tendency of earnings to rise with age as representing social mobility.... \n",
    "\n",
    ">The surprise lesson of the income distribution controversy, then, is what it says about today's conservative mind-set. It turns out that many conservatives, for all their anti-totalitarian rhetoric, have Orwellian instincts: if the record doesn't say what you wish it did, hide it or fudge it.... Many conservatives not only don't want to discuss substance: they prefer not to face reality, and to live in a fantasy world in which the 1980s turned out the way they were supposed to, not the way they did...\n",

    "But perhaps I am ungenerous. Perhaps Simpson has had a change of heart. Perhaps he has traveled his own road to Damascus, come face-to-face with what he had done and who he was, repented, and wanted to repair some of the damage to America and its long-run economic growth prospects that he had caused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in that case, however, naming those who misbehave to important positions of high trust and acclaiming them as bipartisan statesmen gives the next generation really lousy incentives. And it’s not as though Congressional Republicans think they owe enough to Simpson for him to swing a single vote in either chamber of the legislature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obama officials assured me that Simpson had, indeed, had a change of heart; that he was a smart man with a sophisticated understanding of the issues; that he could sway reporters and get them to describe the commission’s advice as “bipartisan” (even though he could not sway actual legislators); and that he would be a genuine asset to the substantive work of the commission.\n",
    "John Berry recently wrote in the online journal The Fiscal Times that not even that is true. Simpson is “condescending and derisive – and wildly wrong about important parts of the Social Security system's past.” Moreover, Simpson apparently does not understand that, as commission co-chair, his job is to build a broad coalition for necessary and mutually beneficial policy changes.\n",
    " \n",
    "Indeed, Berry reports that Simpson now believes that it would be unfair to use general revenues to pay for any portion of Social Security benefits. In other words, the large surplus in the Social Security trust fund, which is made up of government bonds that general revenues are earmarked to pay for, does not really exist and cannot be drawn upon. “Simpson maintained,” according to Berry, that “Social Security is already insolvent because it is paying out more than it is getting in tax revenue.” Never mind that the plan since 1983 has been for Social Security to tax more than it spends for a full generation and then use the built-up surpluses to spend more than it taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "“There is no surplus in there. It’s a bunch of IOUs,” Berry reports Simpson as having said. “Listen. It’s two-and-a-half trillion bucks in IOUs which have been used to build the interstate highway system and all of the things people have enjoyed since it has been set up.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpson is not making sense. All investments are IOUs. A General Electric bond is just that–a promise by the General Electric Company to pay its creditors. A dollar bill is an IOU from the government, just like a Social Security Trust Fund bond is.\n",
    "Perhaps the most bizarre of Simpson’s claims that are quoted by Berry is that the Social Security Commission of 1983 “never knew there was a baby boom....” The baby boom, of course, started immediately after World War II and peaked in 1960. As Berry writes: “Alan Greenspan, who headed...[that] commission...would tell Simpson something different. The big demographic shift that began right after World War II was precisely why...taxes were raised and benefits were cut [in 1983] – to build up a trust fund surplus so benefits could be paid.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Four centuries ago, the consensus, in Western Europe at least, was that good and even adequate government in this fallen world was inevitably a rarity. Democracy always degenerated into mob rule, monarchy into tyranny, and aristocracy into oligarchy. Even when well run, democracy took little interest in the distant future, aristocracy took little interest in the well-being of those whom Simpson calls the “little people,” and monarchy took little interest in anything other than legitimate succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, at the end of the eighteenth century, the founders of the United States of America and their intellectual successors claimed that this pessimism about government was unwarranted. “The science of politics...like most other sciences,” claimed Alexander Hamilton, “has received great improvement....The regular distribution of power into distinct departments...legislative balances and checks...judges holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election...are means, and powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided...”\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps Hamilton was too much the optimist. When I look at Barack Obama’s deficit commission – indeed, look at governance worldwide – I see many imperfections, but few or no examples of excellence.\n",

    "**Clayton Yuetter** (March 24, 1992): _When 'Fairness' Isn't Fair_ <https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/24/opinion/when-fairness-isn-t-fair.html?searchResultPosition=1>: \"Class warfare, discredited throughout the former Communist world, seems to have found new life in American political circles. A front-page article in the March 5 _New York Times_ described one example: an allegation that the recovery of the 1980's—and hence the conservative philosophy of the Bush Administration—helped the rich and hurt the poor. This analysis, a reprise of the so-called fairness argument, rests on a Congressional Budget Office study and an analysis by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, Paul Krugman. The C.B.O. and Mr. Krugman have played prominent roles in shaping the liberal version of the fairness debate, and their allegations have become a staple in the speeches of Democratic politicians. But the analysis suffers from grievous flaws. I will cite just a few. First, the claim that the top 1 percent of taxpayers raked in 60 percent of the benefits of the Reagan-Bush boom rests on a statistical sleight of hand. The C.B.O.-Krugman analysis masks the progress of the Reagan-Bush expansion by throwing in data from the Carter era, when the poor got poorer and the rich got poorer. During the Reagan-Bush boom, by contrast, the rich paid more in taxes and the poor made more in income. Minorities enjoyed a greater leap in wealth, employment and mobility than whites. The middle class shrank because more people became 'rich'. That's the Reagan-Bush record...<!--more-->\n",
    "\n",
    ">...Second, the analysis gives the impression that American society consists of stationary social classes—a sort of human layer cake in which a haughty, unchanging upper class rests atop an oppressed, unchanging underclass. That is pure fiction: Our greatness as a nation arises from the fact that people rise and fall on the strength of their abilities. Many children of the rich fall below the national average income level in their lifetimes, and many poor children rise to riches. Third, the C.B.O. study creates the impression of an increasingly divided America by overstating the \"wealth\" of the top 1 percent and understating the wealth of everyone else. It lumps retirees who have sold their homes into the ranks of tycoons. It overlooks the incredible increase in the values of investments in the Reagan-Bush years. At the same time, the study understates middle-class wealth by overlooking the value of unsold assets like homes, stocks and pension funds. If you count everybody's capital gains, you find that the poor and middle class got the vast majority of benefits of the Reagan-Bush expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    ">But the fairness story involves far more than statistics. It involves values. Many advocates of the \"fairness\" critique want to stoke middle-class resentment by implying that the rich take from the poor. They never seem to realize that a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy can create a bigger pie for everyone. American workers understand how an economy works, however, and so do voters. They don't like the Robin Hood politics of class warfare, and never have. When societies exalt the corrosive instinct of envy they condemn themselves to a poverty of goods and spirit. Moses delivered a commandment that began: \"Thou shalt not covet.\" He and his wanderers understood that an economy runs not just on profits, but on values. The \"fairness\" argument ignores the way the market works. It twists the meaning to advocate a Government powerful enough to transfer money from rich to poor. But no one equates fairness with a Government that grows and raises taxes, regardless of its performance, or that transfers money from the rich and middle class into programs that lure the poor into permanent dependency. Most Americans think about fairness in practical terms. You work hard, and you keep what you earn: That's fair. If you save and invest and take risks, and produce something that fulfills the needs of others, you make a profit. That's fair.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The politics of redistribution are as dead as Leninism. Today, people in former Communist lands beg for copies of the Federalist Papers and \"The Wealth of Nations\"—not for \"The Greening of America.\" They don't seek a sleeker socialism. They seek something like what President Bush calls the Good Society—one built on hard work, decency, thrift, service, family—one that places the individual before government. The C.B.O.-Krugman assault on the Reagan-Bush recovery avoids all these factual and moral subtleties, and muddles a debate that matters to most of us. That's a shame because the fairness debate will shape our destiny. As we take on the tangled issues that arise from it, we will need all the facts and all the real fairness we can get.\n",
