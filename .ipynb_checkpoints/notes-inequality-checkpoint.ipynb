    "**Doug Jones**: _The Patriarchal Age_ <https://logarithmichistory.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/the-patriarchal-age-5/>: \"The left panel shows effective population sizes based on Y chromosome DNA, transmitted down the male line. The right panel shows effective population sizes based mitochondrial DNA, transmitted down the female line. The dramatic dip on the left panel, where effective population sizes go way down in the last ten thousand years, means that there was a period, from the initial spread of major language families to near the dawn of history, where just a few men were leaving lots of descendants in the male line. This must reflect a time when polygyny – some men taking multiple wives, others not reproducing at all – was common. But this pattern probably reflects more than just polygyny. It probably also reflects a continuing advantage, carried over many generations, for some male lines of descent. In other words, back in the day, not just did Lord Y (or whoever) have many wives and many sons, but his sons, his sons’ sons. his son’s son’s sons, and so on, had many offspring. This probably implies some kind of long-term social memory, such that that the “Sons of Y” or the “House of Y” had a privileged position for many generations.... Eurasian history is often told as the story the rise of states and empires. But it’s also the story of the rise of patrilineal descent groups (and the heavy policing of female sexuality to make sure of paternity in the male line)...\n",

    "**Carl O'Donnell** (2014): _What Does It Take To Make The Forbes 400?: Increasingly More And More_ <https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlodonnell/2014/10/03/what-does-it-take-to-make-the-forbes-400-increasingly-more-and-more/#3017f95bbbd4>: \"Every year, the Forbes 400 sets the bar higher. Just making it to the very bottom of this year’s list requires 1.55 billion–250 million more than in 2013. And that’s only a single year. To truly appreciate how quickly the hurdle is rising, Forbes took a look at how much the minimum cutoff increased every year since 1982, when the first Rich List was created. In so doing, Forbes also revisited the millionaires and billionaires who have had the honor of ranking last on the Forbes 400. The poorest person on the list in 1982 was Armas Clifford 'Mike' Markkula Jr., who was then the CEO of a hot tech startup called Apple Computer. He joined the firm in 1977, when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak approached him for funding. Markkula’s net worth in 1982: $91 million. Not bad, but only about one 17th of what he would need to ascend to the Forbes 400 today. Granted, the dollar had more purchasing power in 1982. So how much would 91 million be worth in today’s dollars? About 225 million, still less than a sixth of today's cutoff...\n",
